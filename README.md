# Excel-Analysis-Southern-Water-Corporation-
Personal project focusing on a company's expenses and revenue. 
Southern Water Corporation focuses on three sector that brings in revenue such as Private Water Hedge Sales, Public Sales & Residential Sales.
My project showcases which sector grants the best revenue, while also focusing which seller grants the highest costs.

Additionally, breaking the sector into multiple small unit, I am able to determine which costs makes up the highest expense.
Lastly, EBIT analysis allows me to find the breakevent point using the formula(revenue - costs of goods - OPEX).
